### Distributed SlangCheck Coverage

GUMBOX uses SlangCheck to generate test vectors.  SlangCheck is Sireum's randomized test generator framework similar to ScalaCheck and Haskell's QuickCheck.  By default SlangCheck uses GUMBO datatype invariants, if provided, to reject invalid vectors.  Distributed SlangCheck (DSC) adds a framework that allows test vector generation to be run via a server cluster up to a user specified timeout.  Increasing the timeout allows more vectors to be produced which may lead to increased code coverage during testing.  DSC passes the vectors to user defined unit tests (e.g. the contract-based ``testCompute`` methods generated by GUMBOX) and serializes the passing and failing vectors to seperate files so that they can be replayed if needed.  DSC uses [JaCoCo](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/) to produce code coverage information.

The following summarizes the results of running DSC+GUMBOX on the RTS with different time-out values
